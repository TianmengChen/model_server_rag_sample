        "Create LLM-powered Chatbot using OpenVINO\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots have emerged as powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations. \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant responses.\nWhile a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic, one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions, LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable accuracy.",
        "Previously, we already discussed how to build instruction-following pipeline using OpenVINO and Optimum Intel, please check out Dolly v2 example for reference.\nIn this tutorial we consider how to use power of OpenVINO for running Large Language Models for both chat and QA over document. We will use a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. To simplify the user experience, the Hugging Face Optimum Intel library is used to convert the models to OpenVINO\u2122 IR format. In addition, we will use LangChain to augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data, which allow you to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\u2019s cutoff date.\n\nThe tutorial supports different models, you can select one from provided options to compare quality of open source LLM solutions.\n\nNote: conversion of some models can require additional actions from user side and at least 64GB RAM for conversion.\n\nThe available options are:",
        "Note: conversion of some models can require additional actions from user side and at least 64GB RAM for conversion.\n\nThe available options are:\n\ntiny-llama-1b-chat - This is the chat model finetuned on top of TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T. The TinyLlama project aims to pretrain a 1.1B Llama model on 3 trillion tokens with the adoption of the same architecture and tokenizer as Llama 2. This means TinyLlama can be plugged and played in many open-source projects built upon Llama. Besides, TinyLlama is compact with only 1.1B parameters. This compactness allows it to cater to a multitude of applications demanding a restricted computation and memory footprint. More details about model can be found in model card",
